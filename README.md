## ðŸ’¡ About the project
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of moves, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

For more detailed information, look at the [push_swap.subject.pdf](https://github.com/linhtng/push_swap/files/10668338/push_swap.subject.pdf) and [push_swap_eval_form.pdf](https://github.com/linhtng/push_swap/files/11137815/push_swap_eval_form.pdf)

## Challenge
You start with two empty stacks: **a** and **b**. You are given a random list of integers via command line arguments.
<br />
<br />
Only these moves are allowed:
- `sa` : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `sb` : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `ss` : `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
- `pa` : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.
- `pb` : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.
- `ra` : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
- `rb` : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- `rr` : `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
- `rra` : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- `rrb` : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- `rrr` : `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.
<br />

At the end, **stack b** must empty empty and all integers must be in **stack a**, sorted in ascending order. <br />

## Installation

* Clone this repository:

```shell
https://github.com/linhtng/push_swap.git
```

* Go to the project folder:

```shell
cd push_swap
```

* To compile mandatory part:

```shell
make
```
* After compilation just run ``push_swap`` with your parameters.
* Example of executing ``push_swap`` :

```shell
./push_swap 8 13 20 17 19
```

* Example of executing ``checker`` with instructions received from ``push_swap`` :

```shell
ARG="8 13 20 17 19"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
